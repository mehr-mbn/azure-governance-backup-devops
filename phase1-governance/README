# Phase 1 – Governance with Azure Policy

This phase implements organization-wide governance using Azure Policy.  
The objective is to enforce a standard tagging model and guarantee that all deployed resources remain compliant.

## Tagging Standard

| Tag key      | Purpose                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `environment`| Environment classification (dev/test/prod) |
| `owner`      | Technical or business owner                |
| `costCenter` | Cost allocation grouping                   |
| `criticality`| Impact level used for RPO/RTO & incidents  |

## Policy Architecture

This phase uses two custom Azure Policy definitions:

1. **Append Policy** (`enforce-standard-tags`)  
   - Effect: `append`  
   - Scope: Subscription  
   - Behavior: Automatically adds missing tags to any resource.

2. **Deny Policy** (`deny-missing-standard-tags`)  
   - Effect: `deny`  
   - Scope: Specific resource group (e.g., `rg-deny-test`)  
   - Behavior: Blocks creation of resources without required tags.
