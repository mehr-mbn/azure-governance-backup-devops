# Azure Governance, Backup & DevOps Pipeline Automation

This repository contains a structured 3-phase Azure project designed to demonstrate end-to-end cloud governance, platform resilience, and DevOps automation.

## Project Phases

### **Phase 1 – Governance with Azure Policy (Completed)**
Focuses on establishing Azure-wide tagging standards, enforcing tagging compliance, and combining `append` and `deny` custom policies.

→ Documentation: [`phase1-governance/README.md`](phase1-governance/README.md)  
→ Evidence & CLI output: [`docs/phase1-governance-tests.md`](docs/phase1-governance-tests.md)

---

### **Phase 2 – Backup & Restore with Recovery Services Vault (Completed)**
Implements VM backup and restore using a Recovery Services Vault, validates recovery points, and derives practical RPO/RTO observations.

→ Documentation: [`phase2-backup/README.md`](phase2-backup/README.md)  
→ Evidence & screenshots: [`docs/phase2-backup-tests.md`](docs/phase2-backup-tests.md)

---

### **Phase 3 – CI/CD with Azure DevOps + Key Vault Integration (Planned)**
Implements secure pipelines for IaC and application workloads with secret management.

→ Documentation: `phase3-devops/README.md` (coming soon)
