# Azure Governance, Backup & DevOps Pipeline Automation

This repository contains a structured 3-phase Azure project designed to demonstrate end-to-end cloud governance, platform resilience, and DevOps automation.

## Project Phases

### **Phase 1 – Governance with Azure Policy (Completed)**
Focuses on establishing Azure-wide tagging standards, enforcing tagging compliance, and combining `append` and `deny` custom policies.

→ Documentation: [`phase1-governance/README.md`](phase1-governance/README.md)  
→ Evidence & CLI output: [`docs/phase1-governance-tests.md`](docs/phase1-governance-tests.md)

---

### **Phase 2 – Backup & Restore with Recovery Services Vault (Planned)**
Covers VM backup, restore workflows, and RPO/RTO analysis.

→ Documentation: `phase2-backup/README.md` (coming soon)

---

### **Phase 3 – CI/CD with Azure DevOps + Key Vault Integration (Planned)**
Implements secure pipelines for IaC and application workloads with secret management.

→ Documentation: `phase3-devops/README.md` (coming soon)
